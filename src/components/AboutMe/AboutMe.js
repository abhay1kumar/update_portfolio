        <p>
          I have always been a great problem solver, an independent and a quick
          learner who is willing to learn new things in order for me to grow as
          an individual. I always have the ability to adapt to a changing
          environment. Being a hard worker is what helps me to work in a team,
          But I can also be productive when working alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm familiar with a variety of programming languages, including HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React Js/Next Js, Node Js, Express Js,
          Database (MySQL, MongoDB). I am a Software Developer and a curious
          person who loves to know how different things work together. I love to
          BUILD STUFF and connect with people smarter than me!
        </p>

          When I am not smashing the keyboard, you will find me playing Cricket
          or reading.

          Currently I am a Software Developer at 4 Way Technologies. Okhla
